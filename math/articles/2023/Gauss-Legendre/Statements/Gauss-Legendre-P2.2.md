**Proposition 2.2.** (Legendre's Identity). &nbsp; *Suppose $$ k_1^2 + k_2^2 = 1 $$. Then*

$$
	F(k_1) E(k_2) + F(k_2) E(k_1) - F(k_1) F(k_2) = \frac{\pi}{2}
$$

*holds.*
	
*Proof.* We leave the details of this proof to the reader. Taking the derivative with respect to $$ k_1 $$ shows that the L.H.S. is constant. To see that this value is $$ \pi/2 $$, we take the limit as $$ k_1 $$ goes to $$ 0 $$. $$ \blacksquare $$
