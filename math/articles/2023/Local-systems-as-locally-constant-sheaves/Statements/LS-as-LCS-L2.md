**Lemma 2.** &nbsp; *A locally constant sheaf on a simply connected space is constant.*

*Proof.* Let $$ X $$ be a simply connected space with $$ F $$ locally constant. Then by [lemma 1](https://www.justinasher.me/LS-as-LCS-L1){:target="_blank"} the étale space of $$ F $$ covers $$ X $$. The only covers of a simply connected space are a discretely indexed copies of itself, and hence we can write our étale space in the form $$ p \colon X \times M \to X $$. Since $$ X $$ is connected, the sections of this map are constant, meaning our sheaf is constant. $$ \blacksquare $$
