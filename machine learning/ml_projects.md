### Modeling Catan using self-play (2024)

**Abstract:** I taught a neural network how to play the board game Catan using reinforcement learning via self-play. When training, I utilized both temporal-difference and Monte-Carlos tree search methods, along with a residual neural network structure. This resulting model achieved an intermediate level of play.

### The brain age project (2020)

**Paper:** Asher, Justin; Tan Dang, Khoa; and Masters, Maxwell (2020) "A Differential Geometry-based Machine Learning Algorithm for the Brain Age Problem," *The Journal of Purdue Undergraduate Research*: Vol. 10, Article 40. [Link](https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/jpur/vol10/iss1/40/){:target="_blank"} 

**Abstract:** Our study aimed to find a new method for predicting the age of a subject from their brain biometrics. In order to measure the stretching of the brain tissue, we utilized an isoperimetric-type ratio $ T^2/A $, where $ T $ is the membrane thickness and A is the surface area, for each region of the brain. We found that a multinomial logistic model trained on the ratios preserved, and improved, prediction accuracy. This showed that our dimensionality reduction technique was effective for modeling brain age.
