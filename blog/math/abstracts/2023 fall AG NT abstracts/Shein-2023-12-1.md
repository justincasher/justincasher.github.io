title: Prismatization and prismatic cohomology
---

##### Vladimir Shein, December 1, 2023

**Abstract.** &nbsp; Prismatization is a functor from the category of bounded p-adic formal schemes to stacks over $$ \mathbb{Z}_p $$. Cohomology of the structure sheaf of the stack corresponding to a scheme $$ X $$ is prismatic cohomology of $$ X $$, which can specialize into étale, de-Rham, or crystalline cohomology of $$ X $$.

In the first part of the talk, I will recall the necessary definitions and some classical results. Then I will explain the construction of the prismatization functor and define prismatic cohomology. If time permits, I will discuss the connection of prismatic cohomology to other cohomology theories.
