## 1. Limits and Colimits

&emsp; Recall that a (locally small) category $$ \cC $$ is a class of objects $$ \Ob(\cC) $$ and a class of morphisms $$ \Hom(\cC) $$ equipped with a composition law. Meaning, for any $A, B, C \in \Ob(\cC)$, there exists an associative composition operator 

$$
    \circ \colon \Hom(B, C) \times \Hom(A, B) \to \Hom(A, C),
$$ 

and local identities $$ \Id_A \circ f = f $$ and $$ g \circ \Id_A = g $$.
