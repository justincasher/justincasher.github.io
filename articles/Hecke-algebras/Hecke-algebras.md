**Abstract.** &nbsp; We explain how different definitions of the Hecke algebra relate to each other.

## 1. Classical Hecke operators


&emsp; Let $ k $ be a field, and let $ E $ be a $ k $-variety. The following are equivalent:

1.  $ E $ is an abelian variety of dimension 1 over $ k $;

2.  $ E $ is a smooth, projective curve of genus one with a choice of origin;

we refer to such $ E $ as being *elliptic*.


&emsp; We call a discrete additive subgroup $ L $ of $ k $ a *lattice*. There exists an additive isomorphism of $ L $ with $ \mathbb{Z}^n $; we call $ n $ the *rank* of our lattice. 


&emsp; Assume $ L $ is a complex lattice of rank 2, which we write 

$$
L = \left< w_1, w_2 \right> = \left< a_1 w_1 + a_2 w_2 \mid a_i \in \mathbb{Z} \right>
$$

with $ w_2 / w_1 \in \mathcal{H} $ and $ \mathcal{H} $ the upper-half plane. The quotient $ \mathbb{C}/L $ is an abelian variety of dimension 1 over $ \mathbb{C} $; hence, an elliptic curve. Every complex elliptic curve arises in this manner, and there is a bijection between isomorphism classes of elliptic curves and lattices up to homothety. (This is not true for higher dimensional complex abelian varieties.) In the sequel, we let $ \mathcal{L} $ denote the free abelian group generated by complex lattices of rank 2 (i.e. elliptic curves).


&emsp; A holomorphic function $ f \colon \mathcal{H} \to \mathbb{C} $ is called a *modular form of weight $ k $* if, for any $ \gamma \in \text{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z}) $, 

$$ 
f(\gamma(z)) = (cz+d)^k f(z),
$$

and $ f(z) $ remains bounded as $ \text{im}(z) $ approaches infinity. Equivalently, we define modular forms as homogeneous functions $ F \colon \mathcal{L} \to \mathbb{C} $ of degree $ -k $; meaning, for $ \lambda \in \mathbb{C}^{\times} $,

$$
F(\lambda w_1, \lambda w_2)
= \lambda^{-k} F(w_1, w_2).
$$

Indeed, given a modular form $ f $ of weight $ k $, we put

$$ 
F(a, b) = b^{-k} F(a/b),
$$ 

and given a homogeneous function $ F $ of weight $ -k $, we put

$$ 
f(z) = F(z, 1).
$$ 

This correspondence is bijective, and we denote both of these spaces by $ M_k (\text{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})) $, or just $ M_k $.


&emsp; We define the $ n $-th *Hecke operator* $ T_k(n) \in \text{End}(M_k) $ by 

$$ 
T_k(n) F(L)
= n^{k-1} \sum_{[L : L'] = n} F(L'). 
$$

We call the subalgebra $ H_k $ of $ \End(M_k) $ generated by the $ T_k(n) $ the $ k $-th Hecke algebra.
