**Abstract.** &nbsp; We explain how different definitions of the Hecke algebra relate to each other.

&emsp; Let $ k $ be a field, and let $ E $ be a $ k $-variety. The following are equivalent:

1.  $ E $ is an abelian variety of dimension 1 over $ k $;

2.  $ E $ is a smooth, projective curve of genus one with a choice of origin;

we refer to such $ E $ as being *elliptic*.


&emsp; We call a discrete additive subgroup of $ L $ of $ k $ a *$ k $-lattice*. There exists an additive isomorphism of $ L $ with $ \mathbb{Z}^n $; we call $ n $ the *rank* of our lattice. 


&emsp; Assume $ L $ is a complex lattice of rank 2, which we write 

$$
L = \left< w_1, w_2 \right> = \left< a_1 w_1 + a_2 w_2 \mid a_i \in \mathbb{Z} \right>
$$

with $ w_2 / w_1 \in \mathcal{H} $ and $ \mathcal{H} $ the upper-half plane. The quotient $ \mathbb{C}/L $ is an abelian variety of dimension 1 over $ \mathbb{C} $, or by definition, an elliptic curve. Every complex elliptic curve arises in this manner, and there is a bijection between isomorphism classes of elliptic curves and lattices up to homothety.
