**Lemma 1.** &nbsp; *Let $$ X $$ be a locally connected space. A sheaf $$ F $$ of $$ R $$-modules on $$ X $$ is locally constant if and only if its étale space is a covering.*

*Proof.* &nbsp; Suppose the étale space of $$ F $$ is a covering. Then every point $$ x \in X $$ has a neighborhood $$ U $$ such that the restriction is $$ p \colon U \times M \to U $$. Assuming $$ U $$ to be connected implies that the sections of this map are constant since the topology on $$ M $$ is discrete, and thus our sheaf is constant on $$ U $$. $$ \blacksquare $$
