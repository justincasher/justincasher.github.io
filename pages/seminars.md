This fall I am planning on organizing a seminar on p-adic Hodge theory (or another topic of interest) for the graduate students (or faculty) at Indiana University. Some details:

- We have four people interested in participating including myself.
- If you already know what your schedule looks like, please submit [this survey](https://www.when2meet.com/?19957395-gEG9R).

More information will posted here soon!
