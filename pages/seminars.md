This fall I am planning on organizing a seminar on p-adic Hodge theory (or another topic of interest) for the graduate students (or faculty) at Indiana University. More information will posted here soon!

If you already know what your schedule looks like, please submit [this survey](https://www.when2meet.com/?19957395-gEG9R) so I can start to see when people are available.
