This page contains links to (mostly expository) mathematics articles I have written

1. [The Euler Characteristic is the Index of an Operator]({{'/Euler-Characteristic-is-an-Index' | relative_url}}) <br> *Description:* We show how the Atiyah-Singer Index Theorem is a logical progression from the Chern-Gauss-Bonnet Theorem by relating the Euler characteristic to the index of a Dirac operaator.
2. [The Gauss-Legendre Algorithm]({{'/Gauss-Legendre' | relative_url}})
3. [Local Systems as Locally Constant Sheaves]({{'/Local-Systems-as-Locally-Constant-Sheaves' | relative_url}})
