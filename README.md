### About 

Hi! I am Justin Asher, and this is the code behind my personal website. I am using GitHub pages since it is both dynamic and can render LaTeX (using a combination of KaTeX and MathJax). I am hoping this allows me to organize things more easily.

### Jekyll framework

This website was made using Jekyll Garden v 0.4. The theme is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
