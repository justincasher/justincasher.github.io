title: Differential operators in characteristic p

**Abstract.** &nbsp; I will give an overview of the theory of D-modules in characteristic $ p $. In particular, we will discuss a geometric construction of the Milneâ€™s map (from a global differential forms on a smooth scheme $ X $ over $ p $ to the Brauer group of $ X $) using the Azumaya property of the algebra of differential operators on $ X $.
