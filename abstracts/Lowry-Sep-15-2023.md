**Abstract.** &nbsp; The Casas-Alvero Conjecture asserts that if $$ F(X) \in k[X] $$, $$ k $$ is of characteristic 0, and $$ F $$ shares a root with each derivative $$ F^{(i)} $$, then $$ F(X) = (x - \alpha)^n $$ for some $$ \alpha \in k $$. We show that it is true for polynomials of degree $$ n = p^k $$ for $$ p $$ prime following [\[3\]](#3-references).
