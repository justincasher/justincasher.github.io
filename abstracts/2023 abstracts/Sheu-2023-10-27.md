title: Rational representations of general linear groups in algebraic geometry

**Abstract.** &nbsp; One construction of finite dimensional representations of general linear groups is to apply Schur functors corresponding to some partitions of $ n $ on $ E $. From the other view, these representations are sections of line bundle on some flag variety. I will talk about how these two ways are related.
