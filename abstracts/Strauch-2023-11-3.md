**Abstract.** &nbsp; In the first part of the talk we will describe a classification of 2-dimensional $$ p $$-adic representations of the absolute Galois group of Qp, followed by a review of Colmezâ€™ $$ p $$-adic Langlands correspondence which associates to such a representation r an admissible unitary $$ p $$-adic Banach space representation $$  \Pi(r) $$ of $$ G=GL_2(Q_p) $$.

Then we consider the question for which r the associated locally analytic representation $$ \Pi(r)^\la $$ is generated by $$ H $$-analytic vectors for certain analytic subgroups $$ H $$ of $$ G $$. 

We then state a conjecture which says that $$ \Pi(r)^\la $$ is generated by its $$ H $4-analytic vectors if and only if the representation is $$ B $$-admissible for a certain period ring related to $$ H $$. Finally we give some evidence for the conjecture.
