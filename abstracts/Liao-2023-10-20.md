**Abstract.** &nbsp; Rigid cohomology was first introduced by Pierre Berthelot in the 1980s. It can be understood as a combination and extension of crystalline cohomology and Monsky-Washnitzer cohomology. In this talk, I will give the definition of rigid cohomology and briefly explore its properties and applications.
